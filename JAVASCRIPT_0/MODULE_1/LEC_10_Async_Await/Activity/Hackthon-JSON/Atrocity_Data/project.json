Born into a traditional Mallaah (boatman class) family, she was kidnapped by a gang of dacoits. The Gujjar leader of the gang tried to rape her, but she was protected by the deputy leader Vikram, who belonged to her caste. Later, an upper-caste Thakur friend of Vikram killed him, abducted Phoolan, and locked her up in the Behmai village. Phoolan was raped in the village by Thakur men, until she managed to escape after three weeks.[5]\n\nPhoolan then formed a gang of Mallahs of her own, which carried out a series of violent robberies in north and central India, in search for Revenge. Seventeen months after her escape from Behmai, Phoolan returned to the village, to take her revenge. On 14 February 1981, her gang massacred 22 Thakur men in the village, only two of which were supposedly involved in her kidnapping or rape. Phoolan Devi later surrendered and served eleven years in prison, after which she became a politician. During her election campaign, she was criticized by the women widowed in the Behmai massacre. Kshatriya Swabhiman Andolan Samanvay Committee (KSASC), a Kshatriya organization, held a statewide campaign to protest against her. She was elected a Member of Parliament twice and fought for Dalit & Indigenous Rights.\n\nOn July 25, 2001, Phoolan Devi was shot dead by unknown assassins. Later, a man named Sher Singh Rana confessed to the murder, saying he was avenging the deaths of 22 Kshatriyas at Behmai. Although the police were skeptical of his claims, he was arrested. Rana escaped from Tihar Jail in 2004. In 2006, KSASC decided to honor Rana for \"upholding the dignity of the Thakur community\" and \"drying the tears of the widows of Behmai.\"[6]"

        "Description": "On 22 May 2019, Dr. Payal Tadvi, a 26-year-old Schedule-Tribe Muslim gynaecologist,[75] died by committing suicide in Mumbai.[76] For months leading up to her death, she had told her family that she was subjected to ragging by three “upper” caste women doctors;[77] however, the accused denied of having any knowledge of Tadvi's tribal background.[78][79] They allegedly went to the toilet and then wiped their feet on her bed, called her casteist slurs, made fun of her for being a tribal on WhatsApp groups and threatened to not allow her to enter operation theatres or perform deliveries. A few hours before she took her life, she had reportedly told her mother, once again, about this harassment."
